**GPU Programming Assignment - CS6023: Tank Battle Simulation**

- **Project**: Developed a GPU-based simulation for a tank battle game using CUDA, where tanks engage on a grid battlefield.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Implemented game mechanics including tank firing, hit detection, and score tracking.
  - Handled multiple rounds of gameplay with tanks firing in specified directions, with hits affecting tank health and scores.
  - Managed tank destruction, with tanks firing and taking hits until only one or no tanks remained.
  - Optimized performance by utilizing CUDA for parallel computation, ensuring efficient handling of tank interactions and grid-based calculations.
- **Challenges Addressed**:
  - Efficiently detected hits and managed tank health updates using GPU kernels.
  - Ensured accurate simulation despite complex tank interactions and varying battlefield scenarios.
- **Technologies Used**: CUDA, C++.
